Together with Jeff Bezanson, Viral Shah, and our patron at MIT, Alan Edelman, designed and implemented Julia, a high-level, high-performance dynamic programming language for scientific and technical computing, with syntax that is familiar to users of other technical computing environments.
It provides a sophisticated compiler, distributed parallel execution, numerical accuracy, and an extensive mathematical function library.
The library, mostly written in Julia itself, also integrates mature, best-of-breed C and Fortran libraries for linear algebra, random number generation, FFTs, and string processing.
