*Staff Researcher.*
Jeff Bezanson, Viral Shah, and I, with the support of our patron at MIT, Alan Edelman, designed and implemented [Julia](http://julialang.org), a high-level, high-performance dynamic programming language for technical computing.
Julia has rapidly gained popularity as a high-performance alternative to Python, Matlab and R or as a high-productivity alternative to C, C++ and Fortran.
The language's standard library integrates mature, best-of-breed C and Fortran libraries for linear algebra, random number generation, FFTs, and string processing.
We began development of the language in 2009;
since leaving Etsy in 2011, the design, development, community management, and promotion of Julia has been my full-time job.
