*Networking Researcher.*

- <u>Network Path Prediction Project</u> [2006-2007]:
Invented and prototyped a completely redesigned Network Path Prediction system, including the core prediction algorithm and data structures. This system has since provided real-time datacenter/ISP performance predictions for each client connection to a Citrix Online service.
- <u>Netmap Project</u> [2005]:
Designed and built a prototype system to perform lightweight, real-time mapping of Internet paths between data centers and client hosts, using probabilistic databases and information theory.
- <u>Fast Failover Project</u> [2004]:
Developed and prototyped a robust, scalable multipath route selection algorithm using a modified paired-series t-test. This algorithm [<a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&amp;r=16&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;co1=AND&amp;d=PTXT&amp;s1=20110301.PD.&amp;s2=%28FL.ASST.%29&amp;OS=ISD/03/01/2011+AND+AS/FL&amp;RS=ISD/03/01/2011+AND+AS/FL" target="_blank">USPTO Patent 7,898,968</a>] has since been used by all Citrix Online services to determine when to switch between alternative routes from clients to data centers.
